<h1>Web Game project in TypeScript</h1>
<div style="text-align: justify;" >
<p>During the summer holidays, members of the IT Club of INSA Toulouse had the idea to create a new website for the club to attract new members.
    One of the main ideas was to organize a contest among students with a game we would create. 
</p>

<p>Some members were assigned to work on the website, and I decided to work on the game itself. 
    I coded the game while another member of the club, Emily Holmes created the designs. Here is the result !
</p>

<script src="/dist/app.js"></script>



<div id="game" style="margin: auto; width: 75%;"></div>
</br>

<p>It is a simple runner with 2 teams (red and yellow). 1st year students were assigned a team and had to maximize the score of their team. The theme of the game is the studies with in the background buildings
    from our university. The obstacles are objects that prevent you from passing your exams that you need to avoid (in theory  ðŸ˜‡). 
    During the contest, the students would sign in with a Google account and play. Their score was stored in a database and leaderboards were (still are) available on the club's website (btw, that is what I mostly worked on for the website). And the winner received a Raspberry Pi !
</p>

<p>I coded the game in TypeScript with the web game development framework <a href="https://phaser.io/" target="_blank">Phaser</a>. 
    The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/EyeXion/Phaser_Game_Club_Info" target="_blank">here</a> !
    I also helped a little on the club's website, coded in Angular and with a Flask API, you can check it out <a href="https://www.etud.insa-toulouse.fr/~clubinfo/" target="_blank">here</a>.
