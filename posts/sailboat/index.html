<h1>Sailboat management system in C</h1>
<div style="text-align: justify;" >
<p>A few months ago I did not know anything about sailboats and how they function. If I think about it, I still don't but at least I know how to code on a STM32 µcontroller !
    With 3 other classmates, we worked on a project in C to create a sailboat management system in C using a µcontroller.
</p>

<p>It was my first time in the world of embedded systems and I really did not expect to like it as much as I did !
    I had some electronics knowledge and could code in assembly language but I have never worked on a real project like this.
    The goal was to create a system that would control the sails and display infomations about the boat. Here are the main features :
    <ul>
        <li>Manage the sails position (servomotors) according to the direction of the wind (rotary encoder). We could control the boat's position with a motor and a RF controller</li>
        <li>Get the roll of the boat with an accelerometer and let go of the sails if necessary</li>
        <li>Get the battery level (ADC)</li>
        <li>Display position of the sails and emergency messages (USART)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Evrything was coded in C using the "LL" (low-level) library of the STM32 µcontroller. It was really instresting and allowed me to really understand how (in general) embedded systems function.</p></div>
